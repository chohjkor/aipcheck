  <h1>Aging in Place Readiness Guide</h1>

  <p>
    Aging in Place refers to the ability of individuals to live safely, independently, and comfortably
    in their own homes as they grow older. Rather than relocating to institutional care facilities,
    many people prefer to remain in familiar environments that support their physical, emotional,
    and social well-being.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Aging in Place Matters</h2>

  <p>
    As people age, everyday environments can become challenging. Stairs, narrow doorways,
    poor lighting, and inaccessible bathrooms increase the risk of falls and injuries.
    Planning for Aging in Place helps reduce these risks and supports long-term independence.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Factors to Evaluate</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Home accessibility (entrances, stairs, door widths)</li>
    <li>Bathroom and kitchen safety</li>
    <li>Proximity to healthcare and essential services</li>
    <li>Community infrastructure and walkability</li>
    <li>Ability to adapt the home over time</li>
  </ul>
