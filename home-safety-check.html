<h1>Is Your Home Ready for Aging in Place?</h1>

<p>
Many people assume their current home will continue to meet their needs as they age.
In reality, everyday living spaces can become increasingly challenging over time.
</p>

<h2>1. Safe Movement and Accessibility</h2>
<p>
Stairs, narrow hallways, and uneven surfaces can increase the risk of falls.
Clear pathways and accessible entrances are important for long-term safety.
</p>

<h2>2. Bathroom and Kitchen Safety</h2>
<p>
Bathrooms and kitchens are common locations for household accidents.
Slip-resistant surfaces, adequate space, and thoughtful layouts play a key role
in reducing injury risks.
</p>

<h2>3. Lighting and Visibility</h2>
<p>
Poor lighting can make navigation difficult and increase accident risks.
Proper illumination supports both safety and comfort.
</p>

<h2>4. Emergency Preparedness</h2>
<p>
The ability to respond to emergencies, such as sudden illness or accidents,
should be considered when evaluating a living environment.
</p>

<h2>5. Adaptability Over Time</h2>
<p>
A home that can be modified or adjusted as needs change is better suited
for long-term independent living.
</p>

<p>
These factors vary depending on individual circumstances.
AIP Check is designed to support personal awareness and self-assessment,
not to provide professional diagnoses or guarantees.
