<h1>Is Your Home Ready for Aging in Place?</h1>

<p>
Many people assume their current home will continue to meet their needs as they age.
In reality, everyday living spaces can become increasingly challenging over time.
</p>

<h2>1. Safe Movement and Accessibility</h2>
<p>
Stairs, narrow hallways, and uneven surfaces can increase the risk of falls.
Clear pathways and accessible entrances are important for long-term safety.
</p>

<h2>2. Bathroom and Kitchen Safety</h2>
<p>
Bathrooms and kitchens are common locations for household accidents.
Slip-resistant surfaces, adequate space, and thoughtful layouts play a key role
in reducing injury risks.
</p>

<h2>3. Lighting and Visibility</h2>
<p>
Poor lighting can make navigation difficult and increase accident risks.
Proper illumination supports both safety and comfort.
</p>

<h2>4. Emergency Preparedness</h2>
<p>
The ability to respond to emergencies, such as sudden illness or accidents,
should be considered when evaluating a living environment.
</p>

<h2>5. Adaptability Over Time</h2>
<p>
A home that can be modified or adjusted as needs change is better suited
for long-term independent living.
</p>

<p>
These factors vary depending on individual circumstances.
AIP Check is designed to support personal awareness and self-assessment,
not to provide professional diagnoses or guarantees.

<h2>Who should use this checklist</h2>
<p>
This checklist is designed for individuals who want to evaluate their current
home before problems occur. It is especially helpful for people planning
long-term independent living without relying on institutional care.
</p>

<h2>Who should assess their home</h2>
<p>
This assessment is useful not only for older adults, but also for individuals
in midlife who want to prepare their homes for long-term independent living.
Evaluating a home early makes it easier to prioritize gradual improvements
instead of facing major renovations later.
</p>

<h2>Common issues found in everyday homes</h2>
<p>
Many homes were not originally designed with aging in mind.
Common challenges include uneven floor levels, bathrooms without grab bars,
kitchens that require excessive reaching, and entrances that are difficult to
access without assistance.
</p>

<h2>How readiness affects long-term independence</h2>
<p>
A home that supports Aging in Place can reduce the risk of falls, increase daily
comfort, and support self-reliance. Identifying potential risks early allows
homeowners and residents to make targeted changes that support safer and more
comfortable living over time.
