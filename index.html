      <h2>What Is Aging in Place?</h2>

<p>
Aging in Place (AIP) means having the ability to live safely, independently, and comfortably in your own home as you grow older. 
Rather than relocating to institutional care or assisted living facilities, many people prefer to remain in familiar surroundings 
that support long-term independence.
</p>

<p>
Successful aging in place depends on multiple factors, including home layout, accessibility, safety features, surrounding environment, 
and access to essential services. AIP Check was created to help individuals understand these factors clearly and realistically.
</p>

<h2>Why Aging in Place Matters</h2>

<p>
As populations age globally, housing readiness has become a critical issue. Homes that were suitable earlier in life may no longer meet 
physical or safety needs over time. Falls, limited mobility, and environmental barriers are common challenges that can impact independence.
</p>

<p>
Planning ahead allows individuals and families to identify risks early and make informed decisions. Aging in place is not only about 
staying at home — it is about maintaining dignity, autonomy, and quality of life for as long as possible.
</p>

<h2>What AIP Check Helps You Do</h2>

<p>
AIP Check provides general educational guidance to help users reflect on whether their current living environment supports aging in place. 
It is designed as an informational starting point, not a diagnostic or professional assessment tool.
</p>

<p>
Through structured questions and educational resources, AIP Check encourages users to think about accessibility, safety, and long-term 
housing readiness. The goal is to support better awareness and more proactive planning.
</p>

<h2>Who This Tool Is For</h2>

<p>
AIP Check is intended for individuals, families, caregivers, and anyone interested in long-term independent living. 
It may be helpful for people who are planning ahead, supporting aging family members, or simply exploring how their home environment 
might adapt to future needs.
